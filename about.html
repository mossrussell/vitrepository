            <h1>About the website</h1>
            <p>I learned the html and css coding languages for fun and personal growth, 
                so I decided to use my new skill to create a website that is a repository of viticultural information. Most of the information will be generated by me,
                but I will also bring in useful resources from other folks. 
                It will include viticulture courses, technical how-to videos and other resources as requested/needed.  
                The site will be updated on a regular basis with new material.</p>
                <br>
            <p>If you're keen to learn a bit of coding, I started with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>.  While I'm unlikely to go pro, 
            it is good fun.</p>
